I would first like to express my sincere gratitude to the Faculty of ICT for their continuous support throughout my undergraduate studies. As a student athlete, I faced the dual responsibility of fulfilling both national athletic commitments and academic requirements. The departmentâ€™s understanding and cooperation were invaluable in helping me pursue both responsibilities.

A special thanks to my supervisor Dr Ing. Trevor Spiteri for his guidance and support during this project. His expertise and insights were instrumental in shaping the direction of my research. 

I would also like to thank my parents for their unwavering support in all my endeavours. Their belief in my decisions and the stability they provide is essential in allowing me to fully commit to my academic journey. Lastly, a heartfelt thank you to my sister, who will soon make me an uncle.
