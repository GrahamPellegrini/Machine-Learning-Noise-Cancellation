\chapter{Suppression Effects from Improper \texttt{Tanh} Activation}
\label{appendix:tanh_removal}

Before final evaluations could be conducted, a critical implementation flaw affecting early model performance was identified. Initially all \gls{ml} models, except \gls{convtasnet}, included a \texttt{Tanh} activation function at the output layer. This was based on the assumption that constraining the real and imaginary spectrogram outputs to the range \([-1, 1]\) would improve numerical stability during \gls{istft} reconstruction.

However, during early testing and visualization, this constraint was found to significantly suppress amplitude dynamics. The outputs became unnaturally flattened, leading to degraded waveform clarity and poor denoising metrics. \gls{snr}, \gls{pesq}, and \gls{stoi} scores in particular, even when models appeared to converge during training.

This effect is illustrated clearly in Figures~\ref{fig:suppresed_waveform} and~\ref{fig:suppresed_spectrogram}, models when trained with \texttt{Tanh} applied. The waveforms exhibit a flattened energy profile, and the spectrograms lack contrast and high-frequency content.

\end{figure}

After removing \texttt{Tanh}, the models were retrained. The resulting outputs restored amplitude range and natural structure, both in waveform shape and spectrogram clarity. These improvements are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:restored_waveform} and~\ref{fig:restored_spectrogram}.

\end{figure}

All final models, presented in Chapter~\ref{chp:evaluation} were retrained without the \texttt{Tanh} activation. This correction proved critical to achieving meaningful denoising results and validates the importance of properly scaled output layers in spectrogram-based models.
