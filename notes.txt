Change the appendix section of the project structure to the encapsulated single denoise now.

Conduct Hyperparmater tuning

Deployment Code


Possible needs for changes:


-1.1  However, during evaluation and benchmarking, pre-trained models
will be used for comparison to assess their effectiveness against the proposed
approach.

-1.1 The project is structured into three core phases: training, denoising,
and deployment....

-2.5 and assess their feasibility for real-time embedded deployment
