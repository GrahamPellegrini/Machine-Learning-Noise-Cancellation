CHANGES MADE:
- Removed Improper Tanh() Activation from CNN, CED, RCED, UNet
    Models previously ended with nn.Tanh(), which clamps real/imag spectrogram outputs to [-1, 1]. Suppressing output and creating poor waveform reconstructions. With Low SNR/PESQ/STOI metrics that where clear anomolies.

    This was first visualized when individual denoised audios where plotted for time-domain waveforms and spectrograms. Where the supressed and unnatural flattened enegery was seen.

    
- Mention that the training pipeline and denoising pipeline use a unified SNR calcualtion.


Change the appendix section of the project structure to the encapsulated single denoise now.

Move all introduction paraghraphs for chapters to Overiew section in intro

Evaluation
                    - Check the major 18 x of ConvTasNet compared to the other models seems very large and need to make comments on it.
                    - Compare models subjectively off of single test audios
                    - Compare models to a pretrained model
                    - Oringal metrics of nosiy to clean. (especially for SNR) 
                    - Mention that the metrics taken are of whole bacth of the noisy test set and are averges.

Conclusion
                    - We need to conclude on the question of Classical vs ML
                    - State that although we struggled to find significant imporvements in models and one that did perform well. The results blew through any optimistic results of Classical methods.
                    - State ConvTasNet as our best performer good for deployment
                    - Possibly mention deployment 

Consistenty:
                    - British English not American
                    - \texttt fit for coding names 
                    - \textbf titles

Fix the denoising of the classical single methods

Conduct Hyperparmater tuning

Deployment Code

Possible needs for changes:
    -1.1  However, during evaluation and benchmarking, pre-trained models
    will be used for comparison to assess their effectiveness against the proposed
    approach.

    -1.1 The project is structured into three core phases: training, denoising,
    and deployment....

    -2.5 and assess their feasibility for real-time embedded deployment
