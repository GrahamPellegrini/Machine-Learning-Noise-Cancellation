- Mention that the training pipeline and denoising pipeline use a unified SNR calcualtion.

Change the appendix section of the project structure to the encapsulated single denoise now.

Make introduction paraghraphs for all chapters 

Conclusion
                    - We need to conclude on the question of Classical vs ML
                    - State that although we struggled to find significant imporvements in models and one that did perform well. The results blew through any optimistic results of Classical methods.
                    - State ConvTasNet as our best performer good for deployment
                    - Possibly mention deployment 

Consistenty:
                    - British English not American
                    - \texttt fit for coding names 
                    - \textbf titles

Deployment Code

Possible needs for changes:
    -1.1  However, during evaluation and benchmarking, pre-trained models
    will be used for comparison to assess their effectiveness against the proposed
    approach.

    -1.1 The project is structured into three core phases: training, denoising,
    and deployment....

    -2.5 and assess their feasibility for real-time embedded deployment

Questions to ask:

Should we move the OOM Validation and Dataset evaltions to the appendix

How does the Acronoms work in the latex template
