Change the appendix section of the project structure to the encapsulated single denoise now.

Background          - Move Machine learning here.

Literature Review   - No need for Nueral Networks explination possibly.
                    - Needs to be inforamation sourced from a paper mainly that isnt common knowledge
                    - So Desing and PTO dataset handeling  where paper refernces are directly made. Needs to be moved here and then shorter explination can be made in the Desing. 

OOM Validation 
                    - Metrics are mentioned to cause negligable change but with respect to LSD and PESQ there are signifacnt downgrades.    
                    - Make clear that RCED is being used to conduct the training since it is not as deep of a architecture as Unet or ConvTasNet that mostly expirence the OOM error due to their increased complexity and depth.

Evaluation
                    - Check the major 18 x of ConvTasNet compared to the other models seems very large and need to make comments on it.
                    - Compare models subjectively off of single test audios
                    - Compare models to a pretrained model

Consistenty:
                    - British English not American
                    - \texttt fit for coding names 
                    - \textbf titles

Fix the denoising of the classical single methods

Conduct Hyperparmater tuning

Deployment Code

Possible needs for changes:
    -1.1  However, during evaluation and benchmarking, pre-trained models
    will be used for comparison to assess their effectiveness against the proposed
    approach.

    -1.1 The project is structured into three core phases: training, denoising,
    and deployment....

    -2.5 and assess their feasibility for real-time embedded deployment
